Abstract
Marine tourism offers a significant intersection between recreational activity and environmental stewardship. Salty Pelican Boat Tours, a Gulfport-based maritime tourism provider, exemplifies this relationship by integrating educational, customizable, and ecologically mindful experiences into its offerings. Operating within the biodiverse waters of Florida’s Gulf Coast, Salty Pelican Boat Tours uses its two vessels, The Pelly-Can and The Dolphin Quest, to bridge the gap between public engagement and marine conservation. This paper explores the operations of the company, the ecological importance of the waterways they traverse, and the implications of their offerings on local biodiversity and public awareness.

1. Introduction
Marine ecotourism plays a crucial role in promoting awareness about marine ecosystems, particularly in biodiverse regions such as Florida’s Gulf Coast. Gulfport, a coastal city located in Pinellas County, serves as a gateway to significant waterways, including Boca Ciega Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Clam Bayou Nature Preserve. These aquatic environments, rich in both flora and fauna, form the operational grounds for Salty Pelican Boat Tours.

This paper examines the tour offerings and operational framework of Salty Pelican Boat Tours, highlighting the vessels’ capabilities, their alignment with marine tourism best practices, and their contributions to the preservation of local biodiversity.

2. Vessel Overview
Salty Pelican Boat Tours operates two distinct vessels tailored to different group sizes and purposes:

2.1 The Pelly-Can: Intimate Exploration

The Pelly-Can is a six-passenger vessel designed for private charters and small group experiences. The vessel caters specifically to guests seeking a personalized and intimate interaction with Gulfport’s marine environment.

	•	Functionality: The vessel is highly customizable, offering flexible itineraries to suit various interests, such as sunset cruises, wildlife observation, and secluded anchoring for leisure activities.

2.2 The Dolphin Quest: Versatility and Capacity

The Dolphin Quest is a larger vessel capable of accommodating up to 17 passengers. Its dual-purpose design facilitates both private charters and public eco-tours.
	•	Capacity: Designed for a minimum of seven and a maximum of 17 guests.

3. Ecological Context
The operational waters of Salty Pelican Boat Tours include significant ecological regions, namely Boca Ciega Bay, the Clam Bayou Nature Preserve, and the Gulf of Mexico. These areas represent critical habitats for various marine and avian species and support intricate food webs that are vital to coastal health.

3.1 Boca Ciega Bay

Boca Ciega Bay serves as a semi-enclosed estuary characterized by brackish water, seagrass beds, and mangrove-lined shores. This habitat supports a diverse array of organisms:
	•	Mammals: Bottlenose dolphins are a frequent sight, and manatees are seasonal visitors.
	•	Birds: The bay is home to species such as Egretta caerulea (little blue herons), Pelecanus occidentalis (brown pelicans), and Pandion haliaetus (ospreys).
	•	Marine Life: Seagrass beds act as nurseries for juvenile fish, including economically important species like Centropomus undecimalis (snook) and Sciaenops ocellatus (red drum).

3.2 Shell Key Preserve

As part of the broader Gulf ecosystem, Shell Key Preserve features sandy beaches, salt marshes, and mangrove islands. It serves as a critical nesting ground for Chelonia mydas (green sea turtles) and an important stopover for migratory bird species such as Calidris canutus (red knots).

4. Impact of Tours on Biodiversity Awareness
By combining leisure and education, Salty Pelican Boat Tours fosters ecological consciousness among participants. Captains and guides provide interpretive information about the interconnectedness of Gulf Coast ecosystems, highlighting:
	•	The role of estuaries in nutrient cycling and fishery productivity.
	•	The impact of human activity on dolphin populations, including boat strikes and noise pollution.
	•	The significance of mangrove ecosystems in carbon sequestration and storm protection.

5. Operational Highlights
Salty Pelican Boat Tours distinguishes itself with several operational strengths:
	•	Personalization: Guests are encouraged to customize their itineraries, enhancing the educational and recreational value of each tour.
	•	Eco-Friendly Practices: The company emphasizes low-impact tourism by adhering to no-wake zones and minimizing disturbances to wildlife.
	•	Experienced Crew: Captains Rob and Emily bring a wealth of knowledge about the Gulf’s ecosystems and ensure a safe, engaging experience for guests.

6. Challenges and Opportunities
Despite its success, Salty Pelican Boat Tours operates within a delicate ecological framework. The growing demand for marine tourism necessitates a balance between accessibility and conservation:
	•	Potential Challenges: Increased vessel traffic may contribute to habitat degradation and stress on marine fauna. Additionally, unpredictable weather patterns pose operational risks.
	•	Opportunities: The company is well-positioned to adopt further conservation measures, such as partnerships with marine research institutions and the implementation of citizen science programs during tours.

7. Conclusion
Salty Pelican Boat Tours exemplifies the potential of marine tourism to act as both a recreational and educational tool. By operating in the biodiverse waters of Gulfport, Florida, the company not only provides memorable experiences but also contributes to the growing awareness of marine conservation. As demand for eco-tourism rises, Salty Pelican’s commitment to sustainable practices will play a pivotal role in preserving the Gulf Coast’s ecological integrity.
