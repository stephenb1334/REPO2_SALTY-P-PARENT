A Floating Classroom: Exploring Gulf Coast Ecosystems


Step aboard and join me, Captain Emily, as we embark on a journey of exploration and education along Florida’s captivating Gulf Coast. As the onboard eco-educator for Salty Pelican Boat Tours, I'm here to guide you through the vibrant waters of Gulfport, St. Petersburg, and Tampa Bay, turning each tour into a floating classroom where you'll learn about marine life and ecosystem dynamics.

During our adventure, passengers transform from learners to teachers, sharing newfound knowledge with others. Whether you're marveling at playful dolphins during a Sunset & Dolphins Tour or exploring the intricate seagrass meadows and mangrove forests, each moment is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of our natural world and discover how to preserve it for future generations. Welcome aboard for a day on the water, where education and exploration go hand in hand!


If you come to join us for a tour, I’ll be your guide as we navigate the stunning waters of Gulfport, St. Petersburg, and the Tampa Bay area. With a microphone in hand, I’m here to not only steer you through these incredible waterways but also to immerse you in the fascinating world of Florida’s Gulf Coast marine life and ecosystems.

Every tour is a chance to share my passion for marine biology, conservation, and the incredible wildlife that calls this region home. Whether you’re joining us on a tranquil Sunsets & Dolphins Tour or a lively Dolphin Quest Adventure, my goal is to leave you inspired by the beauty of our natural world and armed with knowledge about how we can protect it.

A Floating Classroom: Exploring Gulf Coast Ecosystems

As we set out on the water, I encourage you to look around and take in the vibrant landscapes surrounding us. From the shallow, life-filled bays to the vast open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, every part of this ecosystem plays a role in maintaining the health of Florida’s marine environment.

The Seagrass Meadows Beneath Our Feet

Right now, as we glide through Boca Ciega Bay, we’re passing over one of the most important habitats in the Gulf Coast region: seagrass meadows. These underwater meadows are often referred to as “nature’s nurseries” because they provide a safe haven for juvenile fish, shrimp, crabs, and even baby sharks. Without these meadows, many species simply wouldn’t survive their early stages of life.

Keep your eyes on the water—you might spot a green sea turtle grazing on the seagrass. These gentle reptiles play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the ecosystem, ensuring the seagrass doesn’t grow too dense and block sunlight from reaching the ocean floor.

Mangrove Forests: The Guardians of the Shoreline

As we hug the coastline, notice the intricate root systems of the mangroves. These trees act as natural barriers, protecting the shoreline from erosion and storm surges. Mangroves are also a hot spot for biodiversity—look closely and you might see snowy egrets (Egretta thula) wading in the shallows or brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) perched in the branches, scanning the water for their next catch.

Mangroves are one of my favorite topics to discuss because they highlight the interconnectedness of our ecosystem. These trees not only support birdlife but also provide shelter for fish, crabs, and even sea snakes. They are a reminder that every part of the Gulf Coast ecosystem is connected.

Open Gulf Waters: Where Dolphins Play

Now, as we venture into the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the excitement builds. This is where we often encounter our most charismatic residents: the bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). With their playful leaps and curious behavior, dolphins are always a highlight of our tours. Did you know that dolphins are incredibly intelligent and social animals? They communicate using a series of clicks and whistles, and each dolphin has a unique sound, much like a human fingerprint.

I love sharing these insights as we watch these incredible animals in their natural habitat. Seeing their joy and energy never gets old, and it’s always a thrill to answer guests’ questions about their behaviors, diets, and social structures.

What Makes Each Tour Special

Every tour is different, and that’s part of what makes my job so exciting. Here are a few of the unforgettable moments I’ve had while guiding guests through the Gulf Coast:
	1.	A Dolphin “Show” During Sunset
One evening, during a Sunsets & Dolphins Tour, a pod of dolphins swam alongside the boat just as the sun was setting. The water turned gold, and the dolphins leapt out of the waves as if they were performing just for us. I grabbed the microphone and shared fun facts about dolphin behavior while the guests took photos, completely awestruck.
	2.	Manatees Grazing in the Shallows
During a private charter, we stopped near Shell Key Preserve and spotted three manatees calmly grazing on the seagrass. As I explained their role in the ecosystem and the challenges they face from boat strikes and habitat loss, the group watched in respectful silence, clearly moved by the sight.
	3.	A Birdwatcher’s Dream
On one eco-tour, we spotted over a dozen bird species in just an hour. From roseate spoonbills with their pink plumage to ospreys diving for fish, it was a birder’s paradise. I love pointing out these birds to our guests and sharing their names, behaviors, and migratory patterns.

What You’ll Learn on Our Tours

As an educator, I want every guest to walk away with not only great memories but also a deeper understanding of the Gulf Coast’s ecosystems. Here’s what you can expect to learn on a tour with me:
	•	Wildlife Facts: From the unique whistles of dolphins to the migratory habits of coastal birds, I love sharing the fascinating details about the species we encounter.
	•	Conservation Tips: Simple actions, like reducing plastic use or following no-wake zones, can make a huge difference for marine life.
	•	Ecosystem Connections: Every habitat, from seagrass meadows to mangrove forests, plays a role in maintaining the health of the Gulf. Understanding these connections is key to protecting them.

Why I Do What I Do

What I love most about being an onboard educator is the chance to inspire others. It’s not just about spotting dolphins or watching a beautiful sunset—it’s about deepening our connection to nature and realizing that we all have a role to play in protecting it.

Last summer, I had a guest tell me that my tour changed the way they see the ocean. They said, “I always thought of the water as just a place to swim or fish, but now I realize it’s a whole world full of life.” Moments like that remind me why this work is so important.

If you’re ready to experience the magic of Florida’s Gulf Coast, I’d love to welcome you aboard. Whether you’re interested in learning about marine wildlife, celebrating a special occasion, or simply enjoying the natural beauty of the Gulf, our tours offer something for everyone.

Title: Navigating the Gulf Coast with Captain Rob: A Captain’s View of Unforgettable Adventures

Ahoy, adventurers! I’m Captain Rob, the guy behind the wheel of Salty Pelican Boat Tours, steering you toward incredible memories on Florida’s Gulf Coast. While my wife, Captain Emily, takes the mic and shares her wealth of knowledge about the region’s ecosystems, I’m in the captain’s chair, making sure we have a smooth ride, the best views, and a journey you’ll never forget. From navigating Boca Ciega Bay to timing our trips for those picture-perfect Gulf sunsets, being at the helm of these tours is a privilege I cherish every day.

Today, I want to give you a glimpse into my world—what it’s like to navigate these stunning waters, the unique moments that happen on the Gulf, and why I believe there’s no better way to experience Florida’s coastline than aboard The Pelly-Can or The Dolphin Quest.

The Magic of the Gulf Coast: A Captain’s Perspective

If you’ve never explored the Gulf Coast from the water, you’re in for a treat. This region is a boater’s paradise, with calm bays, wide-open Gulf waters, and endless natural beauty. From my vantage point in the captain’s chair, I get to witness it all—the playful pods of dolphins, the golden hues of a sunset over the Gulf, and the quiet magic of mangrove-lined shorelines.

Boca Ciega Bay: Where the Journey Begins

Our tours often start in the calm, protected waters of Boca Ciega Bay. It’s the perfect spot to ease into the adventure, especially for families with young kids or first-time boaters. The bay is teeming with life: dolphins often fish near the mangroves, and you might catch a glimpse of manatees grazing along the shore. It’s also a fantastic area to appreciate the beauty of Florida’s natural habitats up close.

The Gulf of Mexico: Open Waters, Endless Horizons

Once we leave the bay and head into the Gulf of Mexico, everything changes. The vast, open water has a way of making you feel connected to the world in a whole new way. The salty breeze, the sound of waves against the hull, and the endless horizon—it’s an experience that never loses its magic. This is where I get to show off some of my favorite spots, from secluded sandbars to dolphin hotspots. And let’s not forget those iconic Gulf sunsets. Every evening, as the sun dips below the horizon and paints the sky in shades of gold and pink, I’m reminded why I love what I do.

Why I Love What I Do: The Captain’s Experience

People often ask me what my favorite part of being a captain is. The answer is simple: it’s all about the people and the moments we create together. Every group that steps aboard brings their own energy and story, and I consider it my mission to make their time on the water as memorable as possible.

Unforgettable Moments on the Water

One of my favorite memories happened just last summer. A couple celebrating their anniversary had booked a private sunset tour on The Pelly-Can. As we cruised through Boca Ciega Bay, dolphins began swimming alongside the boat, leaping and playing in the wake. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect—the golden light of the setting sun, the dolphins’ playful energy, and the couple’s pure joy. It was one of those moments where everything aligned, and I felt lucky to be part of it.

Another highlight was a multi-generational family reunion aboard The Dolphin Quest. With 15 people onboard, ranging from toddlers to grandparents, it was a lively group. We spotted a manatee grazing near the mangroves, and later, a juvenile osprey swooped down right in front of the boat to catch a fish. The kids were thrilled, and even the grandparents said it was one of the best days they’d ever had. Moments like these are why I believe boating is the ultimate way to connect with nature and with each other.
