Salty P and Buddy are the dynamic duo driving Salty Pelican’s educational and operational excellence. Salty P, known as The Salty Professor, is a charming American White Pelican who embodies the spirit of education and adventure.

Every few posts, both mascots introduce new promotions for Salty Pelican boat tours, seamlessly integrating calls to action that encourage followers to book their own unforgettable adventures.
